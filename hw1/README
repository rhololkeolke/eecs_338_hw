Makefile
hw1.c
hw1_script_output.txt (output recorded with script command, see below)
hw1_record_output.txt (output recorded with stdout/stderr redirects, see below)

Compiling
-----------

To compile you can simply run `make`
To remove the compiled files run `make clean`

Running the Program
--------------------

To run the program simply type `./hw1`.

Variable A Behavior
---------------------
A is initialized to 100 in the main thread. Then the main thread forks 3 times to create 3 child processes.
When fork is called it creates a child process with the same state as the parent, but this new process is a copy.
So when the first child process updates A to be 200 it updates only its copy. Which means after the first update
the main process, and child processes 2 and 3 still have A set to 100, while child process 1 has it set to 200.
A similar thing happens when child processes 2 and 3 update A.

In all cases only the child process's own variable A  is updated. So each child process prints that the value of A is 200 and at the end of the program when main prints A it still shows
100. This is because main's copy of A was never modified.

Generating Program Output Logs
-------------------------------------

There are also additional make targets `script_record`, and `redirect_record`.

`redirect_record` redirects stdout and stderr to a file called `hw1_redirect_output`. This is the
better of the two records to use as bash remains the controlling process meaning that `getlogin()`
will be successful, unlike in script.

`script_record` uses script to record the program output. To use type `make script_record`.
This will create a file called `hw1_script_output.txt`. Please note that script breaks
`getlogin()` because script becomes the controlling process and script is not a valid
login terminal. Therefore the script output will contain an error message for the username line

Notes
--------

I was originally having issues having `getlogin()` be successful. It turns out that `getlogin()`
only works when the process is running from a valid login terminal. This means that if you run
the programs from within something such as tmux or screen it will not work properly. It also means
that running from within script will not work properly. If you see an error message please try running
it straight from bash with a valid login terminal.
